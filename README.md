* Bash-like keyboard shortcuts
* Tab completion
* Quoted args
* Support for redirection
* Support for piping together 2 or more commands
* Customizeable prompt
* Support for globs
* Support for aliases (limitation: no semicolons in definition)

TODO:
* Add config file for aliases and prompt

Bugs:

Files & Function Headers:
`main.c`

Contains the loop that prints the prompt, reads, and executes user input.

`builtins.c`

Contains the builtin commands `cd` and `exit`.
```c

/* Expands all strings in an array.
 *
 * Returns a dynamically allocated string array.
 */
char **expand(char **path);

/*
 * Handles all shell built-in commands that are not meant to be
 * executed with exec.
 *
 * Returns 1 if the built-in exists, 0 otherwise.
 */
int handle_builtins(char *argl[]);
```

`prompt.c`

Handles the rendering of the prompt.
```c

/* Sets the global variable 'exit_code' to the given parameter  */
void set_exit_code(int n);

/*
 * Loads the custom prompt and checks its validity.
 * If the given prompt is invalid, then a default one is used instead.
 */
void load_prompt();

/*
 * Gets information for the current git repository.
 *
 * Returns a dynamically allocated string in the format (<branch> <status>)
 */
char *git_info();

/*
 * Returns a dynamically allocated string containing the rendered prompt, with all
 * variables substituted.
 */
char *get_prompt();

/*
 * Returns a dynamically allocated string containing the value associated with a specific variable
 */
char *get_variable();
```

`executor.c`

Handles the execution of commands

```c

/*
 * Trims all single-space strings from a string array
 * Other functions set arguments to single space as a means of removal
 * This function allows that to work.
 */
void remove_spaces(char *argv[512]);

/*
 * Looks for args with quotes in them
 * and combines them into a single arg.
 * Also copies everything over to heap
 * (must be manually freed).
 */
void combine_quoted(char *argv[512]);

/*
 * Check if any redirection needs to be done,
 * and perform them accordingly
 */
void handle_redirect(char *argv[512]);

/*
 * Runs commands that contain pipes.
 * Mirrors the normal program flow but
 * pipes stdin/stdout properly
 */
void handle_pipes(char *cmd, int num_pipes);

/* Runs a command */
void run(char *input);

/* Sends a signal to the currently running process, if it exists */
void signal_process(int signo);
```
